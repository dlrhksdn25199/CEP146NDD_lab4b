# EXCERCISE 2 - Recipe for making a 🧄 Aglio e Olio Pasta
## Ingredients
- Spaghetti
- Garlic
- Olive oil
- Red pepper flakes
- Salt
- Parsley (optional)
- Parmesan cheese (optional)
  ## Cooking instructions
- Boil the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente. Reserve about ½ cup of pasta water before draining.
- Slice the garlic. Thinly slice 4–6 cloves of garlic. You can adjust the amount depending on your taste.
- Heat the olive oil. In a large pan, heat ¼ cup of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat.
- Sauté the garlic. Add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook until golden and fragrant. Be careful not to burn it.
- Add red pepper flakes. Sprinkle in red pepper flakes (about ½ tsp or to taste) and stir for a few seconds.
- Add cooked pasta. Transfer the drained spaghetti to the pan and toss well to coat with the oil and garlic mixture.
- Add pasta water. Pour in a bit of the reserved pasta water to help bind the sauce and add moisture. Stir until well combined.
- Season and garnish. Add salt to taste. Finish with chopped fresh parsley and optional grated Parmesan cheese.
- Serve immediately. Plate the pasta while hot and enjoy!
 # EXCERCISE 3 - Academic Integrity Policy

## Key Definitions
### Academic Integrity
> **Academic integrity** is “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to six fundamental values: **honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage.**”

### Contract Cheating
When a student submits academic work created by a third party as if it were their own.
### Plagiarism
Using another person’s work (words, images, ideas, computations, etc.), as is or modified, without proper citation. Includes **self-plagiarism**.
### Other Key Terms
- **Falsification/Fabrication** – Misrepresentation or forging of records/documents.  
- **Impersonation** – Taking a test/assessment on behalf of another.  
- **Unauthorized Aid** – Use of non-approved resources (e.g., smartphones, AI tools).
